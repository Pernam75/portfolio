				"The Finite Automaton and Regular Expression project involved developing a program that performs several steps related to finite automata and regular expressions. The program allows for reading an automaton from a file, storing it in memory, and displaying it on the screen. One of the key functionalities is to test the presence of epsilon transitions in the automaton, indicating an asynchronous automaton. If the automaton is not a complete deterministic one, the program can generate an equivalent complete deterministic automaton."

				"Another important aspect of the project is the calculation of the minimal equivalent automaton. This involves reducing the automaton to its smallest form while preserving its language recognition capabilities. The program also allows for testing word recognition within the automaton. Additionally, it enables the creation of an automaton that recognizes the complement language and testing word recognition within that language as well.",

				"By implementing this project, I further developed my skills in Java programming and object-oriented programming (OOP). The use of OOP principles allowed for the modular design and organization of the program, making it easier to manage and maintain. Working on this project enhanced my understanding of finite automata, regular expressions, and the algorithms involved in automaton transformation and language recognition.",
